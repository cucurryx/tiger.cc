# tiger.cc

A tiger compiler in modern C++. Both frontend and backend are written without automatic tools. The official grammer reference manual([https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/tiger.html](ttps://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/tiger.html)) has provied all infomation about The Tiger Programming Langugae. However, the EBNF in that manual isn't LL(k), so we can't implement parser by this EBNF in a recursive decline way. Therefore, I transform it to LL(1) grammer([detail](./doc.md)).
